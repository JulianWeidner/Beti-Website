    <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
      <h4>Issue</h4>
      <p>As of 2015, 3.7 million eligible girls across India
        are out of school, and girls in rural areas receive on average less than four years of education. 
        Though poverty is a limiting factor, other contributing obstacles include gender bias in curriculum,
        stigma towards girls’ education, and absence of supporting mindsets from families. SafeCity explains,
        “Inevitably there is this dogma surrounding young girls that educating them is a waste of time and money as they are born only to be married off and manage the household.
        ” This gender disparity remains a significant barrier to education, as the literacy rate for men is almost 20% higher than that of women (82% vs. 65%). 
        The dangerous cycle of parents unable to sponsor their girl’s education is never-ending and inherently strengthens an unjust social imbalance.

      <h4>Why</h4>
        <p>When asked about their goals for the future, many girls have aspirations to lead lives more fruitful than their parents’ but understand that without schooling, they will sadly be forced to follow in their parents’ footsteps.</p>

        <h4>Direction</h4>
        <p> Beti is an organization founded by Dr. Sujit Shukla in ____ 20__ that wishes to help fulfill the dreams of these young children by sponsoring the education of girls in K-12 living in the underserved Mumbai area. Dr. Shukla began the foundation using his own money, but with time and contributions from others, he has been able to extend his hand, reaching 116 girls in the past year.</p>
